# VisionGPT

VisionGPT is a mobile application that allows users to read text from photos and communicate with the ChatGPT API to receive responses based on the text.

## About the Project

This mobile application is developed using React Native. The app enables users to take a photo with their camera or select an existing photo from their device. Then, the text in the photo is detected and read using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology and sent to the ChatGPT API. The ChatGPT API accepts the text as a prompt and returns a response to the user.

## Features

- Photo capturing and selection functionality
- Reading text from photos using OCR
- Communicating with the ChatGPT API
- Displaying responses from the ChatGPT API

## Roadmap

- âœ… Design user interface
- âœ… Use iOS and Android camera
- ðŸ”„ Detect text in images with OCR (soon)
- ðŸ”„ Solve questions in detected images with GPT (soon)
- ðŸ”„ Detect objects in images (soon)
- ðŸ”„ Communicate detected objects to the user with voice and NLP (soon)
